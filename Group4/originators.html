                    <p>Reggae music was shaped by a diverse group of trailblazers whose contributions laid the foundation for its global influence. From Toots Hibbert and The Maytals coining the term “reggae” with their song "Do the Reggay" to Bob Marley's unparalleled global impact, these pioneers blended innovation with cultural expression. Figures like Jimmy Cliff and Peter Tosh pushed the genre's boundaries, using their music to address themes of resistance, freedom, and justice. Visionaries like Lee "Scratch" Perry introduced experimental production techniques that transformed reggae into a dynamic art form, while early influencers like Prince Buster bridged ska, rocksteady, and reggae. Together, these originators not only defined the sound of reggae but also embedded it with messages of resilience, unity, and empowerment, ensuring its legacy as a cultural and political force worldwide.</p>
