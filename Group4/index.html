                <p>Reggae is a vibrant and influential genre of music that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s, with deep roots
                in the island’s rich musical history. Characterized by its unique offbeat rhythms, steady basslines, and socially 
                conscious lyrics, reggae is far more than just a genre; it’s a cultural force that has spread across the globe, 
                symbolizing unity, resilience, and social activism. At the heart of reggae’s appeal is its ability to transcend musical 
                boundaries, blending elements of Jamaican ska and rocksteady with global influences from rhythm and blues, jazz, and 
                African and Caribbean folk traditions. These sounds coalesce to form a powerful and distinctive musical identity that 
                is unmistakably reggae, carrying with it messages of empowerment and connection.
                </p>


                <p>
                Emerging during a period of social and political transformation in Jamaica, reggae became a voice for the oppressed, 
                giving voice to struggles against inequality, poverty, and colonial legacies. The music’s emphasis on issues of social 
                justice, human rights, and spirituality made it a powerful medium for addressing the challenges faced by the people of
                Jamaica and beyond. Reggae’s lyrics often explore themes of love, peace, and hope, intertwined with messages of unity
                and resistance against oppression. These themes resonated deeply with audiences across borders, as people recognized
                their own struggles and aspirations within the music, leading reggae to become a universal expression of resilience
                and solidarity.
                </p>

                <p>
                Central to reggae’s worldwide popularity are legendary figures such as Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Burning Spear, who 
                each contributed to its global rise. These artists were more than musicians; they were activists and ambassadors for a 
                new vision of peace and justice. Bob Marley, in particular, became a global icon, with songs like "One Love," "Redemption
                Song," and "Get Up, Stand Up" rallying millions in the pursuit of love and equality. Their music transcended cultural 
                boundaries, offering people everywhere a powerful reminder of the strength in unity and the possibility of change. 
                This wave of reggae, known as roots reggae, helped to establish a deep connection between the genre and the Rastafarian 
                movement, which remains an integral part of reggae’s identity.
                </p>

                <p>
                Today, reggae continues to inspire and influence artists across diverse musical genres, from hip-hop and punk to pop and 
                electronic music. Modern reggae artists keep the genre alive, innovating while staying true to its roots, and its legacy 
                is felt not only in music but also in global social movements advocating for justice and human rights. Reggae festivals 
                draw international audiences, and reggae’s rhythms and messages resonate with listeners who seek music that speaks to 
                both the soul and the mind. Through its evolving sound and timeless themes, reggae remains a celebration of life, 
                resilience, and the ongoing struggle for freedom, inspiring listeners around the world.

                <article>

                    <div class = "bio">
                        <p> 
                            Amonee Austin is a Junior at FAMU, originally from Sarasota, Florida, but relocated to a small town on the 
                            outskirts of Tampa called Apollo Beach as a teenager. She is the second oldest of four children on her mother’s 
                            side and the oldest of two on her father’s side. Amonee will be the first graduate from a historically black 
                            colligate university in her family. She loves traveling, shoes, and music. Her favorite place to travel to is 
                            the Dominican Republic because she has a brother there; she loves all her shoes. Equally, she tries not to show 
                            favoritism, and her favorite artist is Rod Wave.
                        </p>
                        <p> She received her associate’s degree in Criminology from Hillsborough Community College. After interning with the
                            Manatee and Sarasota County Medical Examiner office, she decided that doing autopsies was not what she wanted to 
                            do in her career. Amonee was 23 years old when she realized that she needed to get serious about life, 
                            specifically her future, so after completing a semester at the University of South Florida and almost going to 
                            the Air Force twice, Amonee decided that she was going to move away from home and pursue her studies in IT at 
                            Florida Agriculture & Mechanical University.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Amonee has always loved technology since she was a child. She would go to the library, where the librarian would 
                            allow the kids from summer camp to disassemble and assemble their old computers. Her passion for technology has 
                            grown into wanting to pursue a career in Cyber Security.

                <h3>Kameron Norwood</h3>

                <article>    
                    <img src = "images/kameron_norwood.jpg" alt = "Team member Kameron Norwood" height = "300 px" class = "bio-pic">
                    <div class = "bio">
                        <p> Kameron Norwood is an undergraduate senior computer science major at the College of Florida Agricultural & 
                            Mechanical University. Before attending college, he played football in high school and chose to pursue either 
                            football or computers for his future. Ultimately, he decided to focus on computers because he saw that a career 
                            in computer science would offer more excellent opportunities for success than an athletic career. 
                            This choice has proven suitable for him, as he feels satisfied.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During his college education, he has gained and developed experience in several programming languages, such as C++,
                            Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. In addition to being proficient in these languages, he has done various projects that
                            combined essential techniques such as object-oriented programming, lists, queues, and natural language processing.
                            These projects have contributed to expanding his skill set in computer science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When he graduates from FAMU, he intends to pursue a career related to computer science, more specifically, working 
                            in the video game industry or for video game-related companies. Growing up playing video games almost daily, he was 
                            often disappointed with how developers made their games and treated their player base. He would like to make a 
                            difference in many games of today by listening to the players since it would make games more successful.
                            Though initially focused on back-end development, Kameron broadened his skills to include front-end development.
                            One of his current goals is to become a “jack of all trades” developer who can adapt to mixed roles and challenges.
                            This approach allows for greater flexibility and career growth in the long term.

                <h3>Ashiera Preston</h3>

                <article>
                    <img src = "images/ashiera_preston.jpg" alt = "Team Member Ashiera Preston" class = "bio-pic">
                    <div class = "bio">
                        <p> Ashiera Preston is an undergraduate Computer Engineering scholar from Crawfordville, FL, with a wide range of 
                            academic and personal interests to which she devotes an inconsistent amount of time. Cooking was probably her 
                            first hobby; she has been cooking for as long as she was allowed in the kitchen, and it has since become a
                            heavily utilized skill. In her later years, she discovered the piano. Her family could never afford lessons 
                            (being from a lower socioeconomic class), so she taught herself on a keyboard her parents bought for her 9th
                            birthday. The keyboard had keys that lit up and pre-programmed lessons she followed to build her speed and 
                            agility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The guitar came into her life later, during her junior year of high school. She took guitar as an elective and 
                            has continued to practice independently ever since. Though her piano practice has been inconsistent, she hopes 
                            to commit to regular lessons in the future. Her academic interests include programming, computer-automated 
                            design, mathematics, language, linguistics, and literature. The former three are well-utilized in her major,
                            while the latter three have been impacted by the demands of higher academia and standardized testing. She hopes
                            to revive her adolescent reading habit and once again immerse herself in stories between the pages of books.
                        </p>
                            To date, she has completed two internships with the federal government. Her first internship was with the 
                            Department of Defense, and her current internship is with Sandia National Laboratories. Over the summer at 
                            Sandia, she has had the privilege of working on a project that utilizes artificial intelligence to drive robotic
                            agent decisions. After graduating, she plans to pursue a PhD and further explore the applications of AI.
